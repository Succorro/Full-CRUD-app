# Hat Shop App

## Description

This React application uses Ruby on Rails in order to create a full stack single page application.

This shop uses a combination of React and ROR. The implementation of Rails allows for seemless interaction with the database using Active Record. Sinatra is used to communicate with the backend and ensures full CRUD capability. In addition to the React front end, the backend follows RESTful conventions.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository into your local computer.
2. Cd into front end directory
3. Run snippet in directory:
   `npm install`
4. Run snippet in directory to start React server:
   `npm start`
5. Cd into back end directory
6. Run snippet in directory:
   `bundle install`
7. Run snippet to start backend server:
   `bundle exec rake server`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the specified section directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Hosts the app and opens a browser window to display App.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view if the browser does not open.

The page will reload if you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `bundle install`

Installs all gems needed for full backend implementation.

### `bundle exec rake server`

Runs the backend server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
